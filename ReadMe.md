# Memory Game

Welcome to the **Memory Game**, developed for the **Full Stack Club at Bennett University**. This interactive and visually appealing game was created to be showcased at the **Club Carnival event**. The game challenges players to test their memory by matching pairs of cards, making it both entertaining and educational.

# Features

## 1. **Interactive Card Matching**
   - The game features 16 cards arranged in a grid.
   - Players flip the cards two at a time, trying to find matching pairs.
   - If the cards match, they remain flipped; if not, they flip back over, and the player can try again.

## 2. **Randomized Card Placement**
   - Every time the game is started or reset, the cards are shuffled to ensure a unique and unpredictable experience.
   - This randomization enhances the challenge, as players cannot rely on memorizing card positions from previous rounds.

## 3. **Smooth Animations**
   - Cards flip with a smooth animation, providing a polished user experience.
   - A subtle "shake" effect is added when the cards do not match, adding a fun visual cue for the player.

## 4. **Responsive Design**
   - The game is designed to work well on various screen sizes, ensuring that players can enjoy it on both desktops and mobile devices.

## 5. **Simple and Clean UI**
   - The user interface is straightforward, focusing on the game itself without unnecessary distractions.
   - The use of icons and images makes the game visually appealing and easy to understand.
